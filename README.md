PLANT QUEST

Plant Quest was created having in mind the thousands of litres of water that are wasted yearly in homes around the world, watering  and growing plants that would have no chance of surviving on their own.

With hundreds of thousands of plant species across the globe, there are surely one or two that might just do beautifully in your home without constant supervision and climate control.

But a privately curated garden takes hours of research... and most gardening apps will help the user modify their environment rather than rendering suitable options for an already-established medium.

Plant Quest matches the circumstances of a user's garden and their personal preferences with a plant's ideal living conditions, resulting in multiple suggestions of plants that will prosper in the inputted environment with minimal care.

The database can be populated by active members or the application and they are also able to see the most recent suggestions generated to other users.

This project was developed as part of a learning exercise at IronHack web development bootcamp. Naturally, as students, our team committed several mistakes before arriving at any functioning features, which without a doubt provided  the biggest rewards taken from the project.

Nonetheless, some are worth mentioning. The generation of information through the union of data from several databases and input instances was a complex process that needed to be revisited many times.

Implementation of CRUD
Coherent and functional design
Team work

Given the learning scope of this project and its short timeframe, there are a lot of features left on the backburner for a future date, such as an interactive climate zones map, as well as a simplification of the concept.

A "What other plants do you have in this environment?" parameter, used to improve the suggestion results through symbiotic combinations as well as a broader set of user communication options, with a comment section and further feedback mechanisms.
