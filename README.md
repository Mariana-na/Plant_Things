Plant Quest is a gardening app that matches its user's environment characteristics with a series of plants that thrive in those conditions.

The app was created having in mind the thousands of litres of water that are wasted yearly in homes around the world, watering and growing plants that would have no chance at surviving on their own.

With hundreds of thousands of plant species across the globe, there are surely one or two that might just do beautifully in your home without constant supervision and climate control.

However, a privately curated garden takes hours of research, and most gardening apps will help the user modify their environment rather than render suitable options for a medium already established.

Plant Quest allows its signed-up members to reply to a simple questionnaire about their garden/home specificities and their personal preferences. This information is then matched with a plant's ideal living conditions. Resulting in multiple suggestions of plants that will prosper in the inputted environment with minimal care.

The plant database can also be populated by active members, who might have insightful suggestions on additional plant species! 
A feedback page is available where people can see the most recent suggestions generated to other users and leave reviews on the quality of these recommendations. The app will use this information to improve its performance. 

This project was developed as part of a learning exercise at IronHack Web Development boot camp. In line with the scope of creating an application with persistent storage, all CRUD functions were developed and implemented into the program using JavaScrypt as the main programming language. EJS templating allowed for the use of HTML markup engaged with JS. And CSS was used in the styling of the website. Cloudinary API permitted the additional feature of image upload by the user.

Naturally, as students, our team committed several mistakes along the process. These reaped, without a doubt, the biggest rewards taken from the project. The generation of information through the union of data from several databases and input instances was a complex process that needed to be revisited many times. The management of all the different facets of the application both on the front and back ends challenged our ability to track and maintain a coherent and functional design. And overall the implementation of the many features so new to us, from the CRUD functions to the imagery API.

Teamwork in itself can be a challenge. In this case, it was undoubtedly an added value. Cooperation values came through naturally and ease of communication allowed our team to overcome the arising obstacles, as well as keep pushing beyond the minimum requirements.

Given the learning scope of this project and its short timeframe, there are a lot of features left on the backburner for a future date. Such as an interactive climate zones map, as well as a simplification of the concept. An "What other plants do you have in this environment?" parameter, to improve the suggestion results through possible symbiotic combinations. A broader set of user communication options, including a comment section and further feedback mechanisms. And possible monetization attributes, namely shopping links to plant-selling enterprises.
